# DANE-ZAA
A group project at XR workshop.
This VR project was co-developed during the XR International Workshop (Victoria University, 18.02-20.02.20, Wellington New Zealand) by Dominic Flavio Tjiptono, Mairi Gunn, Ali Kahwaji, Stephen FitzHerbert, Kevin Shadlock and Christian Spicer.
The project was a invited contribution to a larger artifact construction ('the indigenous VR expereince') between Kevin Shedlock and Christian Spicer and a first nations group. The task for this project involved creating the opening sequence of the VR artefact. 
If you are working with indigenous groups and would like further information contact Kevin Shedlock and/or Christian Spicer (kevin.shedlock@ecs.vuw.ac.nz).
